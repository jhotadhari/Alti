### Alti

Mapsforge render theme, with focus on altitude.

It's almost entirely a copy of the elements theme (symbols/patterns/code).
But altitude lines copied of the andromaps_hike theme (code).
And landscape names (volcanos, mountain peaks, passes, saddles) copied of Desert theme (symbols/code).

All symbols/patterns/code are copies of these other themes. Alti doesn't contain anything else then copies of these themes.

Therefore all credits to them:

Its not licensed for commercial usage because it's a copy of parts of other themes. And these themes require the whole contents to be included for commercial usage.

For non-commercial usage you are free to reuse everything I made if you stick to those conditions:
